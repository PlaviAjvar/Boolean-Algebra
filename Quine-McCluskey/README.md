# Quine-McCluskey

Implementation of Quine-McCluskey algorithm for minimization of
logic functions. Supports both disjunctive and conjuctive forms,
as well as don't care combinations. 

Implementation of prime implicant minimization using a bitmask 
dynamic programming approach, which is asymptotically superior 
to a direct brute force approach.
